Types of Hashing:
    1.Division Method.
    2.Mid Square Method.
    3.Folding Method.
    4.Multiplication Method.

Collision: Same index for different elements:
Resolution of collision:
    1.Separate chaining: Linked List  (Open Hashing(closed Adddressing))
    2.Linear probing: (h(k)+i)%M  (Closed Hashing(Open Adddressing))
    3.Quadratic probing: (h(k)+i^2)%M  Closed Hashing(Open Adddressing)
    4.Double Hashing: (h1(k)+i*h2(k))%M  (Closed Hashing(Open Adddressing))
